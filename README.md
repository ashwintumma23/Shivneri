#### Why is this tool christened Shivneri?
[Shiveri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivneri) is the name of an Indian land fort in the state of Maharashtra, my home state. It is the birth place of an Indian King and statesman named, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who led the genesis of Maratha empire. The reason I choose the tool to name Shivneri is that, it signifies birth, and I consider this tool as the birth of my distributed systems work. Also, I learnt the art of naming the tool as something meaningful from the tool named [Raigad](https://github.com/Netflix/Raigad), which is Netflix's OSS.
